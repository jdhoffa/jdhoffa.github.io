Stranded assets refer to investments that have become obsolete or unprofitable

Can occur as a result of changes in:

  + market conditions

  + technology

  + regulations

  + other factors.

These assets are no longer able to generate economic value for their owners and may even become liabilities

Examples:

  + Fossil fuel reserves that are left untapped due to stricter environmental regulations or the adoption of renewable energy sources may become stranded assets
  + Investments in industries that are being disrupted by new technologies, such as traditional retail or media companies, may also become stranded assets

Climate physical risk refers to the potential harm or damage to physical assets, infrastructure, and human populations caused by climate change-related events such as floods, hurricanes, droughts, wildfires, and heatwaves.

These risks arise from the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and other climate-related phenomena that threaten the stability and resilience of societies and economies worldwide.

  + Direct losses:

    + such as property damage and infrastructure destruction

  + Indirect losses:

    + such as business disruptions, supply chain interruptions, and financial market instability.

Effective risk management strategies for climate physical risks include assessing vulnerability and exposure to climate-related hazards, implementing adaptation measures, and promoting mitigation efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit the scope of future climate impacts.

These risks directly affect banks, potentially increasing:

  + [Credit Risk]({{< ref "/pages/Credit Risk" >}})

  + Market Risk

  + [Liquidity Risk]({{< ref "/pages/Liquidity Risk" >}})

  + [Operation Risk]({{< ref "/pages/Operation Risk" >}})

  + Reputation Risk

This threatens the profitability and solvency of banks and the overall stability of the financial system. They can either be gradual in nature, such as rising temperatures and sea levels; or abrupt, as in the case of extreme weather events such as wild fires and storms

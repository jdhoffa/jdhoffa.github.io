Transition risk refers to the risk of financial loss or other negative impacts that can result from the process of transitioning to a low-carbon economy. It is a type of environmental risk that arises from the ongoing shift towards a more sustainable and less carbon-intensive economy, as governments, companies, and individuals take steps to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change.

Transition risk can take many forms, including:

  + Policy risk: Changes in regulations, policies, and laws that affect the value of investments, such as carbon taxes, emissions trading schemes, and renewable energy mandates.

  + Market risk: Changes in the demand for goods and services, as well as the price of fossil fuels and other commodities, as a result of climate change mitigation efforts.

  + [Reputation risk]({{< ref "/pages/Reputation risk" >}}): The potential for negative public perception or damage to a company's brand if it is perceived as not doing enough to address climate change.

Investors, financial institutions, and companies are increasingly aware of the potential impact of transition risk and are taking steps to manage it. This includes conducting climate-related stress tests, developing strategies for transitioning to a low-carbon economy, and incorporating climate risks into financial decision-making.

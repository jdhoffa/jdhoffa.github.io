What follows are my notes on the above podcast:

What are the  limitations of will and discipline?

  + How can you

With curiosity, maybe you can find something that interests you about something, you won't hate doing it anymore

Life driven by desire instead of denial

Will and attention are not mutually exclusive

  + Consider each individually as tools

  + Consider which is more useful

Limitations of will and discipline

  + Cure our faults by attention and not will

  + Will only controls a few movements of a few muscles

    + Movements are associated with the idea of the change of position of nearby objects

    + I can will to put my hand flat on the table

    + If inner purity, inspiration or truth of thought were associated with attitudes of this kind, they could be the objects of will

    + As this is not the case, we could only beg for them

  + If you were writing a book with only will, you can write pages and pages, but it might be uninspired

    + At this point, you are just wasting trees

    + What could be more silly than to tighten our muscles and will ourselves to write a good poem

  + If all you practice is will and discipline, and you never practice intention, you are only physically inserting yourself into moments

    + What do you do?

    + Find a way to convince yourself you don't want to be inspired? 

    + Beg someone else to inspire you?

    + You cannot will these kinds of inspirations into existence, you need to do the work

God as a frequency:

  + The self/ ego is an antenna

  + The frequency can be called God, the universe, mass consciousness, etc.

    + Universal messages or collective wisdom exchanged by people culturally

  + Whatever you call it, you don't access these more universal messages when you are locked into a closed system of thinking like an ideology

  + If we were in a world where nobody had ever done the work or had transended experiences that were calibrated enough to receive this frequency:

    + There would be no new beauty, no creativity, no justice

    + If you live in that world, the atheist is right

    + Needs to be a person ready to interpret these

How to practice attention:

  + How do we become a better antenna to receive the frequency

  + The more you practice, the better you get the more messages you receive

  + Three activities to develop a recognition of an underlying implicit love of god (move away from the particulars to access the universal):

    + Love of the beauty of the world

    + Love of your neighbour

    + Love for ceremonies

Develop an ability think as clearly as possible

  + Lucidity to develop moderation and courage

  + The value of moderation and courage extend beyond our own moral consistency:

    + Resist anything in our world politically without ourselves becoming frenzied in the process

  + You can always take the road less travelled, and refuse to join a collective way of thinking, there are situations where this is not enough

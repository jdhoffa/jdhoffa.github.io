Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems, or from external events. It is a type of risk that arises from the day-to-day operations of an organization and can occur due to a variety of reasons, such as human error, technology failure, fraud, legal and regulatory compliance issues, and natural disasters.

Operational risk can affect an organization's reputation, financial performance, and regulatory compliance. It is important for organizations to identify, assess, and manage operational risks to prevent potential losses and ensure the continuity of business operations. Effective risk management involves implementing controls and processes to minimize the likelihood and impact of operational risks, as well as developing contingency plans to respond to potential incidents.

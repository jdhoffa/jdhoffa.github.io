Liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to meet financial obligations as they come due, without incurring unacceptable losses or costs.It arises from the mismatch between an organization's assets and liabilities in terms of their maturities and liquidity.

Liquidity risk can occur due to a variety of reasons, e.g.:

  + unexpected changes in market conditions

  + sudden shifts in investor sentiment

  + inability to sell assets quickly enough to meet obligations

For example, a company may experience liquidity risk if it has too much short-term debt and not enough cash on hand to meet its financial obligations.



Effective management of liquidity risk involves maintaining adequate levels of cash and liquid assets, such as marketable securities, to meet short-term obligations. Financial institutions, such as banks, often hold reserves of cash and liquid assets to meet potential liquidity needs. Additionally, organizations can use various tools, such as credit lines, to manage their liquidity risk.

Liquidity risk management is important because inadequate liquidity can lead to financial distress, reduced creditworthiness, and reputational damage, which can ultimately impact an organization's long-term viability.

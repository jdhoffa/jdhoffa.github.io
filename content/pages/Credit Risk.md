Credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet their financial obligations. It is the risk associated with the possibility of default by a borrower or counterparty on a loan, debt security, or other financial contract.

Credit risk can occur due to various factors, such as the borrower's financial condition, the quality of collateral, the terms of the loan or contract, and the economic and market conditions. For example, a company may experience credit risk if it extends credit to a customer who later fails to pay their bills.

Effective management of credit risk involves assessing the creditworthiness of borrowers and counterparties and establishing appropriate credit policies, limits, and terms. This can involve conducting credit checks, analyzing financial statements and credit reports, and monitoring credit exposures. Additionally, organizations can use various tools, such as credit derivatives and credit insurance, to manage their credit risk.

Credit risk management is important because default by borrowers or counterparties can lead to financial losses and a reduction in creditworthiness, which can ultimately impact an organization's financial stability and reputation.

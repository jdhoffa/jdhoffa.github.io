RMI Strategic Takeaways:


  + Public discourse is beginning to get quantitative about climate risk estimates, and trying to provide some fundamental uncertainty estimates

  + Useful empirical basis for inclusion of physical risks in supervisory policies (duh)

  + Is it possible to mimic such a quantitative system analysis, but corresponding to transition risk?

Summary:


  + Not many existing empirical studies of climate change and environmental risks effect on bank balance sheets

  + Empirical study of aggregate impact of physical risks from climate and environmental-related natural disasters on bank balance sheets across 184 countries over nearly 40 years

  + Estimation technique: [[local projection method]]

  + Dataset:

    + Large, unbalanced panel dataset

    + Consisting of 184 countries over 1980-2019

  + Findings: Severe natural disaster episodes can lead to an increase in the level of system-wide non-performing loans (NPLs) to total gross loans: [[NPL ratio]]

  + Cross-country results complemented with country-specific example:

    + Finds: typhoon damages lead to a significant increase in non-performing loans in the Philippines between 2011 and 2018

  + Suggests financial policy and supervision has role to play to monitor, assess and mitigate climate and environmental related physical risks to the banking sector



Background:

  + Financial sector authorities are devoting greater attention to climate risks in the banking sector:

    + [[Bank for International Settlements]]

    + [[Network for Greening the Financial System]]

  + Global standard-setting bodies have recently issues guidelines for the assessment, management and supervision of such risks:

    + [[Financial Stability Board]]'s roadmap for addressing climate-related financial risks:

      + https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P070721-2.pdf

    + [[Basel Committee on Banking Supervision]]'s principles for effective management and supervision of climate-related financial risks:

  + There is a need for quantitative estimates of the materiality of climate change on the financial system, with quantitative uncertainty estimates

  + Credit risk may arise from:

    + Income effect:

      + Direct effect of hazard events on the likelihood of borrowers' to repay and service debt

    + Wealth effect

      + Loss of collateral or destruction of physical assets diminishes borrowers wealth, affecting banks ability to fully recover the value of a loan in case of bankruptcy

  + Credit risk may be mitigated by:

    + Keeping borrowers afloat can finance the recovery in the aftermath of a disaster, by:

      + Government intervention

      + Availability of insurance

      + Financial support by banks or alternative funding sources

  + Empirical question as to which of these effects is greater

  + Explore how these effects differ depending on economic development:

    + Less developed economies may have fewer resources and shallower financial markets to manage the losses from extreme events

  + Summary of emerging policy recommendations for financial authorities to monitor, assess and manage climate and environmental physical risks to the banking sector

  + Risks emerge from two sources:

    + [Physical Risk]({{< ref "/pages/Physical Risk" >}})

      + Derive from natural disasters and gradual permanent shifts of the climate that lead to economic costs and financial loses

      + Potentially increase:

        + Credit, Operational, Market, Liquidity, and Reputational risks

    + [Transition Risk]({{< ref "/pages/Transition Risk" >}})

      + Related to cost adjustments during the transition towards a carbon-neutral economy

      + Related to:

        + Climate policies

        + technological changes

        + Shifts in investor and consumer sentiment wrt climate change

      + Could be mild if transition occurs smoothly, or severe if transition is abrupt

        + [Stranded Assets]({{< ref "/pages/Stranded Assets" >}}) increasing the chance that borrowers are unlikely to repay their debt obligations with negative repercussions for lenders

Findings:

  + Severe natural disaster episodes can lead to an increase in the level of system-wide non-performing loans (NPLs) to total gross loans: [[NPL ratio]]

  + Cross-country

    + Effects can be persistent

      + 1 year after official declaration of emergency: [[NPL ratio]] estimated to increase 0.37 percentage points

      + 2&3 years after official declaration of emergency: [[NPL ratio]] cumulative increase to 0.56 & 0.6 percentage points respectively

    + Effect observed across multiple regions:

      + East Asia and Pacific

      + Latin America and the Caribbean

      + South Asia

      + Sub-Saharan Africa

    + Observed across almost all income groups except lower-middle-income countries

    + Interpret results with caution due to limited sample at country-year level, and lack of consistent cross-country source of disasters

  + Country specific/ regional-level:

    + Impact of typhoons on Philippines:

      + Highly exposed country to climate related natural disasters

      + Found that 1 percentage point increase in typhoon damage ratio could lead to 2.3 percent NPL ratio:

        + typhoon damage ratio = amount of damage divided by regional GDP

  + Tentative evidence that environmental related natural disasters may be associated with several other key banking sector variables

    + Increases in net interest margin

      + Higher cost of financial intermediation

    + Increase in Capital adequacy

    + Increase in bank credit to the private sector

    + Decrease in liquidity-to-deposit ratio

  + Policies:

    + Policies taken by financial authorities could play an important role in monitoring, assessing and mitigating climate and environmental related physical risks to banking sector

      + Collect information to track such risks

        + Fill any data gaps that may hinder a full understanding of such risks

      + Policy makers could consider more detailed assessment of risks

        + Various risk channels that may be at work behind the empirical results

        + For banking sector, a stress testing exercise would be an important option

      + Direct links presented in this paper could provide inputs to the stress test

      + Estimates do not account for granular and indirect channels of impact and non-linearities associated with forward-looking risks

Data used:

  + Large, unbalanced panel dataset

  + Consisting of 184 countries over 1980-2019

    + Largest time horizon for which major financial sector indicators of interest are available

  + Countries in all income groups and multiple regions

  + Focus on instances of disaster against total damages because:

    + Damage figures are missing for most developing countries (would introduce a wealthy country bias)

    + Anecdotal evidence suggest that these damage figures aren't reliable

  + Eight types of natural disasters"

    + Wild Fire

    + Volcanic Activity

    + Earthquake

    + Storm

    + Landslide

    + Drought

    + Flood

    + Extreme Temperature

  + Specific events can occur many times in a country each year

  + However an episode is defined if the event occurs at least once in a country in a year

    + Typically more occurrences than episodes

  + Climate and environmental related natural disasters have increased in frequency between 1960 and 2020

    + Figure below indicates that number of disaster episodes has almost tripled since 1960

  + Disaster figures broken down by income and disaster groups/ subtypes:

    + Most frequent disaster episodes are hydrological

      + Mostly affect upper and lower middle income countries

    + Meteorological also common

      + Predominantly affect higher and lower middle income countries

  + Variability of average NPL ratios over time

    + Generally NPL ratio has been declining since 1995

    + Decline most notable in EAP and MENA

    + In LAC and SA trend has been growingw

      + Against a backdrop of increasing disasters, suggests a possible relationship between financial stability and disasters

    + NA has a variable trend

    +

    + 

    + 

  + Relationship between NPL ratios (right axes) and the number of disaster events during five-year intervals (left axes)

    + Generally downward trend, except LAC and SA

Empirical Methodology:


  + Skipping this for now as I think it's out of scope. If interested, I urge you to read the paper

Empirical Results:

  + Effect of disaster episodes on NPLs

    + Severe climate and environmental related natural disaster episodes lead to an increase in the level of system-wide NPLs to total gross loans, effects can be persistent

  + Effects are robust across multiple regions

    + Including East Asia and Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean, South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa

    + In general, confirm that it isn't one single region that is driving the results

  + Effects of disaster across income type:

    + Observed across all, except for lower-middle income

  + Effects if disaster across disaster type:

    + Several disaster types are expected to have significant effect on the level of system-wide NPLs:

      + Volcanic activity

      + Wildfires

      + Landslides

      + Droughts

    + 

    + 

Impacts of typhoons on the stability of the Philippine banking system:

  + The Philippines is among the most disaster-prone countries in the world

  + 60% of total land area and 74% of total population are exposed to multiple natural hazards

  + Many exacerbated by climate change:

    + Typhoons

    + Floods

    + Storm surges

    + Tsunamis

    + Landslides

  + In past year, 33,000 people have died and 120 million people have been adversely affected by disasters

  + Philippines currency = PHP = Philippine peso

  + NPL components:

    + NPL data from the Philippine central bank

  + Using a panel local projection model, with correction for future biases and controlling for past regional economic growth, found that:

    + 1 percentage point increase in the damage ratio (typhoon damage over regional GDP) leads to

    + 0.72 percent in the year of the disaster

    + Abates over subsequent years
